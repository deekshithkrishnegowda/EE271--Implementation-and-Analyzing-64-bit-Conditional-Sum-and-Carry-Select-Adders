The purpose of this project is to implement, optimize and analyze the performance of two
different kinds of 64-bit adders(which can perform both addition and subtraction): 
1. Carry Select Adder 
2. Conditional Sum Adder. 

The implementation is done with 8-bit groups and at RTL level. The analysis is performed for three metrics: 

1. Timing performance (RTL and netlist simulation) 
2. Circuit area 
3. Power consumption.
